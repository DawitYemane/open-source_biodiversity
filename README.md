<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains the codes and most of the data used in the
publication *Use of openly available occurrence data to generate
biodiversity maps within the South African EEZ* that is currently in
press in the *African Journal of Marine Science* \[publication details
to follow soon\]. The main purpose of the projec are:

  - To demonstrate how readily available species occurence data and
    environmental data can be used to construct maps of biodiveristy by
    stacking species distribution maps
  - To provide comprehensive maps of biodiversity of *benthos*,
    *fishes*, and *zooplanktons* within the *EEZ* of South Africa
