# open-source biodiversity maps

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains the codes and most of the data used in the
publication *Use of openly available occurrence data to generate
biodiversity maps within the South African EEZ* that is currently in
press in the *African Journal of Marine Science* \[publication details
to follow soon\]. The main purpose of the projec are:

  - To demonstrate how readily available species occurence data and
    environmental data can be used to construct maps of biodiveristy by
    stacking species distribution maps
  - To provide comprehensive maps of biodiversity of *benthos*,
    *fishes*, and *zooplanktons* within the *EEZ* of South Africa

# Note

Currently the R codes used throughout the lifecycle of this project and
locally (on my laptop) compiled report are uploaded to github. The
processd occurrence data are not uploded in this round largely due to
file size (about 10GB) which at the moment is costly for the authors to
both upload to and host in github. At a later stage some parts of the
processed data will be uploaded.
