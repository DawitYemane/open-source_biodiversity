<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains the codes and most of the data used in the publication _Use of openly available occurrence data to generate biodiversity maps within the South African EEZ_ that is currently in press in the _African Journal of Marine Science_ [publication details to follow soon]. The main purpose of the projec are: 

 - To demonstrate how readily available species occurence data and environmental data can be used to construct maps of biodiveristy by stacking species distribution maps
 - To provide comprehensive maps of biodiversity of _benthos_, _fishes_, and _zooplanktons_ within the _EEZ_ of South Africa
